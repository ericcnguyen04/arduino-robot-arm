# Six-Axis Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm

## Progress to Date
- Completed 3D printing of all robotic arm components based on the reference design.
- Prepared inventory of printed parts and hardware required for assembly.

## Next Steps
1. Assemble the 3D-printed components into the full arm structure.
2. Install servo motors, screws, and mechanical fasteners.
3. Build the gesture-sensing glove and integrate flex sensors and an accelerometer.
4. Test and verify Bluetooth communication between the glove and robotic arm.
5. Program the Arduino to enable real-time gesture-based control.
