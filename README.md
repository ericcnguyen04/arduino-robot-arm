# Six-Axis Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm

## Progress to Date
- Completed 3D printing of all robotic arm components based on the reference design.
- Prepared inventory of printed parts and hardware required for assembly.

## Week 1 Update
After receiving STEC approval and access to the project budget, I ran into a roadblock: figuring out exactly what components to buy. Since I must use approved sources, I’ve been overthinking what’s actually necessary for the prototype.  
For example, I’m unsure if countersunk screws are essential, or if roundhead screws will work for most of the arm structure.  

**Goal for Week 1:**  
- Remake the parts/equipment spreadsheet with items from approved sources.  
- Purchase the required products to begin physical assembly.  
- Consider buying screw sets (e.g., M3/M4 kits) to account for variations in size during prototyping.  

## Next Steps

## Next Steps
1. Assemble the 3D-printed components into the full arm structure.
2. Install servo motors, screws, and mechanical fasteners.
3. Build the gesture-sensing glove and integrate flex sensors and an accelerometer.
4. Test and verify Bluetooth communication between the glove and robotic arm.
5. Program the Arduino to enable real-time gesture-based control.
